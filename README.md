# JavaSketch
A little etch-a-sketch clone I made using HTML/CSS/JavaScript! Utilized a pretty great colorpicker right here that I had a lot of fun playing with: https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker ! Anyway this is kind of rough and I'd love to add more but for now this is what I've got andit was a lot of fun!
